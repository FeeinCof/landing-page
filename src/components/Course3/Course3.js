                            <p>Overwhelmed by all the different questions you may get asked during the product management interview?</p>
                            <p>Your time is limited and valuable so no <b>there's no fluff content </b>in our course. We filmed PMs from various top companies answering the <b>85 interview questions </b>below to show you what <b>10-out-of-10 responses look like. </b>All our <b>HD videos</b> are <b>professionally annotated </b>with graphics & notes to aid visual learners and show you exactly what to whiteboard. We explain the nuances of being an exceptional intervieweeâ€”from adding strategic framing in your answers to the body language you should exhibit.</p>
